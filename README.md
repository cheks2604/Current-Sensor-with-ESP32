## Smart Energy monitor with ESP32

## Overview
A wireless current sensing and monitoring system built on the ESP32 Dev board platform. The project measures and logs real-time current data, demonstrating IoT-based data acquisition and embedded monitoring.

## Features
- Real-time current measurement with ESP32  
- Wireless transmission for data display/logging  
- Tested across multiple load conditions  
- Arduino IDE implementation  

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 Dev Board  
- Arduino IDE  
- Current sensor module  

## How It Works
The current sensor captures load current data and sends it to the ESP32. The ESP32 processes and transmits the information wirelessly for monitoring and analysis.
## Note
The smartenergymonitorlocal arduino code may or may not work with your home router as it is connected to your home wifi
## Future Improvements
- Add cloud integration for long-term data storage.  
- Implement mobile app/GUI for real-time visualizatio
